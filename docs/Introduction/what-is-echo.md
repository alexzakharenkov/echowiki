## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

There are existing, `well-developed` and  [`code`](http://google.by) well-supported software development ecosystems. The best of them is IA-32 architecture ecosystem – the most widespread, tried and true processor for desktop computers. This ecosystem provides a wide array of various tools: programming languages, compilers, linkers, code analyzers and verifiers, integrated developed environments, disassemblers, libraries, etc. There is a wide variety of tools, many of them well-developed and well-supported, and which will be supported in future by already existing communities forced by demands of the big market of desktop computer systems. If the bytecode of a blockchain virtual machine fully reproduces IA-32 architecture than that VM will have IA-32 ecosystem automatically inherited. But the problem with this approach is that IA-32 is a CISC ISA designed for hardware and it has a huge burden of legacy stuff required solely for reverse compatibility with outdated software systems. For example, real mode, segmentation addressing model and some instructions are completely rejected in modern software systems, but are still supported by IA-32-compatible CPUs. However, the idea to create an original ecosystem, dedicated solely to ECHO VM, has been rejected. New programming languages, compilers and linkers are not proposed within ECHO VM. Instead ECHO VM inherits IA-32 ecosystem though special bridge introduced as a part of ECHO VM reverse virtualization system. This bridge is a special tool, which performs checking of IA-32-executable binaries and repackaging into ECHO VM Smart Contract files. Additionally, internal ECHO VM removes all burden of legacy stuff from IA-32, leaving just the functionality actually used by modern software.<br>
