Namely:

- The way to determine participation of a specific party in each particular step is changed
- Disposable, derived keys for network messages signing are renounced.
- The way of generating a shared random state in the third step of the BBA algorithm is changed.

To achieve that, Echo employs role model and extensively relies on the concept of verifiable randomness. ECHO functions on the basis of rounds. During each round a new block of transactions is added to the top of blockchain.

In EchoRand consensus, every user is automatically able to participate in the block production and validation process, either by running a node or delegating to an existing node. Each new block of transactions is generated by a committee randomly chosen from the set of all network users. There is no requirement to lock up or "stake" currency, add computing power, or earn the votes of other users - every network user is eligible. However, the task of securely choosing this committee out of the pool of all users would typically require a large coordination, communication, or computation overhead for the network. In addition, when this committee of block producers is announced by the network, the chosen actors could be come the subject of bribe or DDoS attacks.

EchoRand solves this issue of coordination through a cryptographic trick called a verifiable random function (VRF), which is a pseudo-random function introduced by Silvio Micali, Michael Rabin, and Salil Vadhan. Using this VRF, each user essentially participates in their own, individual lottery to determine if they were a "winner" for that given block, with the winning tickets eligible to participate in block production. The key innovation is that each user can do this by themselves, without any coordination necessary with the other users. However, all users can easily validate if a ticket is an unforgeable, cryptographically signed "winning ticket". In addition, each users likelihood of winning the lottery is proportional to their balance of tokens.

Once each EchoRand user participates in this lottery, called cryptographic sortition, the "winners" immediately generate a block of transactions and broadcast it to the network, along with their winning lottery ticket. In this way, the network only knows who is chosen as block producer when the block has already been shared with the network, eliminating the opportunity for bribe and DDoS attacks.

Once the signed blocks are broadcast to all users, a similar "lottery drawing" is held for an additional set of winners who participate in verifying the block and voting on it's validity. The set of winning users in this lottery "verifiers" come to consensus on the best block to add to the network through Byzantine agreement, and once agreement is reached, all users on the network add the block to their local copy of the ledger.

- **set of producers** - an identified by the protocol for the current block list of participants, that are given the opportunity to propose a block option for the current round
- **set of verifiers** - an identified by the protocol for a specific step list of participants, that are trusted to perform the verification actions which are defined by the step, in which they were chosen.

there is no way to predict what seed should be generated by each producer before its reception from producer.

- **Byzantine agreement problem** - is a condition of a computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. The term takes its name from an allegory, the "Byzantine Generals' Problem", developed to describe this condition, where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable.
